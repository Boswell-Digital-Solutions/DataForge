# Model findings debugging pilot

Pilot: `BDS-MODEL-FINDINGS-TOP10-v0.1`
Repository: `Boswell-Digital-Solutions/DataForge`
Baseline commit: `b84276587258d4c71990ddd8453dddb839a2416d`
Owner: Charles Boswell
Cohort: later structured intake; initial comparison baseline
Activation: after this documentation change is merged; no observation clock has started in this packet.

## Purpose and boundary

Test whether preserving model-raised concerns and consulting their investigation history improves debugging enough to justify the effort. This is a manual repository-documentation pilot. It introduces no runtime persistence, model calls, release verdicts, or automated gates. Existing authority, CI, and human-review requirements continue to apply.

The repo-level record is [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md). Reuse existing issue IDs and component records; link them rather than copying their content. Findings are engineering notes, not an automatic promotion into DataForge or a canonical ecosystem classification.

## Operating-context evidence

Record the exact deployed configuration that shaped the review; do not infer behavior from a vendor, model family, or harness name alone. The BDS Evidence Library in Drive `/Forge` is a research and evidence surface. It is not the mutable repository execution workspace, and the two boundaries must not be described with one ambiguous `/forge` label.

For governed work, Registry remains authoritative, the worker executes only the bounded approved flow, operator approval remains external, and Forge_Command presents state, evidence, and decisions. A diagnostic shell or scripting escape hatch, when admitted, remains inside the execution-workspace and proposal boundaries; it is not an approval bypass.

Tool-count thresholds from external research are hypotheses for BDS evaluation, not policy. Record the active capability profile and observed failures so later analysis can compare exact configurations.

## Four-week operation

The cohort clock is recorded in the [Forge_Command pilot log](https://github.com/Boswell-Digital-Solutions/Forge_Command/blob/main/docs/model-findings/sessions.yaml); dates are recorded when work actually begins, not inferred from this file's creation or merge. Charles Boswell coordinates the phase transition already described by the pilot.

- Weeks 1–2: Forge_Command, Author-Forge, NeuroForge, dataforge-Local, and hephaestus use structured intake and consult relevant prior findings before investigating.
- Weeks 1–2: forge-smithy, tarcie-reviewer, DataForge, Forge-Agents, and bds_website continue their existing review process, with only minimal timing/outcome notes for comparison. Handle and record real issues normally; do not withhold findings or fixes for the comparison.
- Weeks 3–4: all ten use structured intake. Record each repo's actual activation and any deviations. A quiet repository contributes no effectiveness conclusion.

This repository begins in **`baseline_after_merge`**. The shared scaffold alone is not the intervention; the measured change is structured intake plus consulting prior dispositions. Until that phase is active, the checklist below is staged guidance.

## Documentation-review checklist — structured phase

1. Pin the reviewed commit, review scope, source reports, and model/version when known. Mark missing provenance `unknown`.
2. Search relevant open and closed known issues before debugging. Record whether a prior entry changed the next action; do not claim estimated time savings as measured time.
3. Capture each distinct actionable concern, or link it to an existing ID. Enter untested claims as **unverified**; separate enhancement suggestions from defects.
4. Separate observed facts, expected behavior, and the proposed cause. Include affected code and the smallest confirming/refuting check. Prefer an executable reproduction when practical; retain human reproduction steps when appropriate.
5. Record checks actually run, their result, contradictory evidence, and missing access. Use **confirmed**, **disproven**, or **inconclusive** only as supported. Failed reproduction alone does not prove absence.
6. Give unresolved findings an owner, next action, and review trigger. A model's age, confidence, or agreement with another model does not establish severity or correctness.
7. Link any fix and its relevant verification at the corrected commit. Preserve disproven findings with rationale and scope; reopen on new evidence or changed conditions. Keep verification state separate from work disposition.
8. Before closing the review, account for every supplied concern and record the documentation build/validation outcome separately. A passing doc build does not close a product issue; merely logging an unverified claim does not fail a release gate.

Source modules under `doc/system/` remain the editing surface. Run `bash doc/system/BUILD.sh` when they change and preserve the repo's current generated output names. Use supported native parity checks. Do not hand-edit generated artifacts or change designation policy for this pilot.

## Concise issue template

Use the existing repo vocabulary where available. The example below is a template, not a reported defect. Unknown values stay unknown. Keep relevant excerpts only and redact secrets or private user content.

```yaml
id: <existing-or-new-stable-issue-id>
title: <specific-claim>
source: {review: <reference>, model: unknown, date: <actual-date>}
reviewed_commit: <sha>
affected_paths: []
observed: <facts-or-explicitly-unobserved>
expected: <behavior-or-governing-requirement>
hypothesis: <possible-cause>
check: <smallest-confirming-or-refuting-step>
evidence: []
verification: unverified
disposition: open
severity: <level-and-rationale-or-unknown>
owner: Charles Boswell
next_action: <bounded-step>
review_trigger: <event-or-date>
fix_and_verification: []
```

## Measurement

Record actual sessions in [model-findings/sessions.yaml](model-findings/sessions.yaml). Minimal baseline notes capture task type, active work minutes, waiting time, outcome, and issue references. Structured-phase notes additionally distinguish capture effort, false-alarm effort, and evidence reuse. Missing timing is `null`, never zero or a number inferred from PR age.

For a session, capture `session_id`, `started_at`, `phase`, `reviewed_commit`, `task_type`, `source_model`, `issue_ids`, `active_minutes`, `recordkeeping_minutes`, `false_alarm_minutes`, `inconclusive_minutes`, `waiting_minutes`, `outcome`, `verification_ref`, and `prior_evidence_reused`. Also capture an `execution_context` with the exact harness and version when known, active capability profile and exposed-capability count, workspace boundary, invalid invocation count, retry-loop count, output-truncation count, escape-hatch use, and human-correction count. Unknown values remain `null` or `unknown`; they are never inferred from product or model names. Recordkeeping and investigation categories are subsets of active time, not extra time to add again. Separate setup cost from ordinary task cost.

Use zero or more `failure_modes` values when observed: `registry-misroute`, `schema-rejection-loop`, `semantic-tool-overlap`, `observation-truncation`, `workspace-boundary-violation`, `environment-state-drift`, `escape-hatch-dependency`, `verification-gap`, or `plausible-but-unproven-fix`. These classify evidence; they do not by themselves establish an application defect.

At four weeks, compare comparable tasks: total active time to a verified disposition, verified fixes per active hour, recording overhead, false-alarm effort, repeat investigations, and reopened fixes. Report unresolved cases and per-repo samples. For unique adjudicated defect claims, precision is confirmed / (confirmed + disproven); show duplicates, enhancements, and inconclusive cases separately. Cross-repo copies of one root cause count once at ecosystem level.

The proposed practical review point is at least 30 adjudicated concerns across five active repos; this is not statistical power. A 20% improvement in comparable median active time or verified-fix yield is a proposed usefulness threshold, not a promised effect. Include overhead and regression outcomes. Sparse or confounded evidence means inconclusive. Keep model versions and workflow changes visible.

## Research basis

- [Using Hypotheses as a Debugging Aid](https://arxiv.org/html/2005.13652v1): controlled support for offering testable explanations; limited small-task setting.
- [What Makes a Good Bug Report for an AI Agent?](https://arxiv.org/html/2607.07593v1): 2026 preprint supporting concrete evidence, expected behavior, and localization; benchmark limits apply.
- [BitsAI-CR](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.15134v1): industrial precedent for verification and structured feedback; its performance is not a BDS prediction.

## Setup evidence

The pinned repository has a working `doc/system/BUILD.sh`. A dedicated `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` already existed and its entries are preserved. Baseline and candidate builds are recorded in the PR. Setup findings are excluded from debugging-effectiveness metrics. No comprehensive runtime review is claimed.
